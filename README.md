Building Accessible and Inclusive Digital Systems

Welcome to the Building Accessible and Inclusive Digital Systems masterclass repository! ðŸŽ‰ This repository contains all the resources, code examples, and activities youâ€™ll need to follow along during the masterclass and to continue your journey toward creating accessible and inclusive digital systems.

Overview

In this masterclass, youâ€™ll:
	Understand the principles of accessibility and their impact on users.
	Explore and apply WCAG guidelines and the POUR principles.
	Learn how to use semantic HTML, ARIA roles, and accessible patterns to build inclusive interfaces.
	Build and debug interactive components like dropdowns, forms, modals, and navigation menus.
	Test accessibility using tools like screen readers and keyboard navigation.
	Automate accessibility testing into workflows like CI/CD pipelines.

This repository is structured to complement the masterclass content and provide you with hands-on activities, code snippets, and challenges.
